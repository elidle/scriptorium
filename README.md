## Running the code locally

First, run the startup file:

```bash
./startup.sh
```

Then compose the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Visiting the deployed app

Other than running the code locally, you can visit our deployed app on `scriptorium.fun`. Note that since we are using the free plan on AWS, we cannot always keep the the app deployed.
